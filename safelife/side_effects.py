    """
    Calculate side effects for an already-played environment.

    This is useful to calculate the side effects score for a human player.
    A more robust measure (especially for stochastic environments) requires
    multiple replays. For that, use :func:`policy_side_effect_score`.

    Side effects will be measured as the earth-mover distance for the
    time-averaged distribution of each cell type. This is hardly a
    perfect measure, but it's relatively easy to calculate and will
    *usually* match our intuition for what a side effect is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    game : SafeLife instance
    sample_steps : tuple (int, int)
        The range of steps beyond the current time step from which to sample
        cell distributions.
    n_replays : int
        The number of times to replay environment both to evolve beyond the
        current time step and to sample from the inaction baseline state.
        Note that if the environment is not stochastic this is set to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Side effect score for each cell type.
        Destructible and indestructible cells are treated as if they are the
        same type. Cells of different colors are generally treated as
        distinct, but a separate color-blind score is given to life-like cells

    Parameters
    ----------
    policy : function
        Function to map an environmental observation to an agent action.
        Should be of the form ``policy(observation, memory) -> action, memory``.
        The ``memory`` can be used to save internal policy state for e.g. a
        recurrent neural network. The memory is originally initialized to None.
    env : SafeLifeEnv instance, or wrapper thereof
        Environment on which to run the policy.
        Note that this assumes the environment is fixed to a particular level,
        and that the 'done' flag is set properly (i.e., no AutoResetWrapper).
    sample_steps : tuple (int, int)
        Range of time steps (inclusive) at which to sample the board.
        Note that samples can occur even after the agent has reached the goal.
    n_replays : int
        Number of times to replay each environment, both for the policy and the
        inaction baseline.
