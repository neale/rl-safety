"""
The syntax tree is used to build complicated 'spells' during game play.
Each new command gets pushed onto the tree, either adding to or filling out
its terminal node. Once a tree is complete, it can be executed on a given
game 'state'. The state only needs to define a few distinct functions:

    - execute_action(action) -> 0 or error
    - check(condition) -> boolean
    - define_subprogram(name, program) -> 0 or error
    - call_subprogram(name) -> 0 or error

The syntax tree will step through all of the commands, executing each one
on the state in turn. The state is then responsible for handling the actions
and all of their effects.

Note that this module is *not* required to run the environment. For the moment
it's just used for interactive play, and even there it's largely experimental.
Players can ignore all of the more complicated commands and just move the
agents one place at a time.
