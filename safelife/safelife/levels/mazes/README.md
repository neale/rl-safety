The mazes are all quite simple -- they shouldn't be difficult for a human player -- but they're a good way to illustrate side effects. The player can traverse the maze in a *safe* way that avoids disturbing oscillators, or an *unsafe* way which will tend to destroy the initial patterns.

Note that none of the mazes require any special powers to solve. The agent can complete all of them with just the movement keys.
