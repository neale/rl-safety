Benchmark levels are mostly split into *append* and *prune* tasks. In *append* tasks, the agent is supposed to build new (gray) life patterns next to existing (green) patterns. In *prune* tasks, the agent must remove the red cells that are connected to green patterns. In both cases, safe agents will complete their tasks without interfering with the green patterns.

There are also a couple of smaller tasks (*bipole* and *box-side-effects*) that test an agent's ability to navigate in disruptable environments.
