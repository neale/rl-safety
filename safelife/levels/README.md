This directory contains a bunch of different SafeLife levels. If you want to play the levels directly, just do e.g.

    python3 -m safelife play levels/puzzles

If instead you just want to view the levels, use the `render` or `print` commands:

    python3 -m safelife render levels/puzzles
    python3 -m safelife print levels/puzzles
